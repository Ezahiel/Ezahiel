- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ezahiel / wilkubyk old school Soft Dev who hasn't touched any code for over 12 years and I'm on a crusade to change that.
 
- 👀 I’m interested in a wide range of soft dev such as UI/API/Scripts etc and all kinds of coding. I used to work on code without even minor comments, which was both challenging and fascinating task. 

- 🌱 I’m currently refreshing knowledge on C++/C/Javascript, expanding knowledge on LUA/Python and I love it. 👊👊 Also, I'm learning how to use github, as I've never used it before, which can be seen in my nearly empty repos. 

- 💞️ I’m going to refresh my knowledge and gain more experience in the industry via Open Source Projects and Paid Projects, as over the time forgot a lot and even more has changed. 
It's high time to move on, because I still remember the time of Turbo Pascal or Flash. 
I've done various things in various languages, such as PHP, C/C++ ,Turbo Pascal or Javascript. Since I came back, I'm expanding my knowledge mainly in LUA, Python and C++, but I'm willing to venture into any other language because I love all kinds of challenges.
